# 2. Declarative Programming Techniques

>"The nice thing about declarative programming is that you can write a specification and run it as a program. The nasty thing about declarative programming is that some clear specifications make incredibly bad programs. The hope of declarative programming is that you can move from a specification to a reasonable program without leaving the language."   
>\- The Craft of Prolog, Richard O’Keefe

- An operation is declarative if it always returns the same results (when called with the same arguments) independent of any other computation state.
- A declarative operation is:
    - independent,
    - stateless,
    - deterministic.
- Declarative programming is important because of two properties:
    - Declarative programs are compositional.
        - They consist of components that can each be written, tested, and proved correct *independently* of other components and of their own past history (previous calls).
    - Reasoning about declarative programs is simple.
        - Simple algebraic and logical reasoning can be used.
- Not all programs can be easily written in the declarative model.
    - As many components (in a program) as possible should be declarative.
- This chapter explains how to write practical declarative programs.
- The basic technique for writing declarative programs:
    - Consider the program as a set of recursive function definitions.
    - Use high-orderness to simplify the program structure.

## 1. Iterative computation
- An iterative computation is a loop whose stack size is bounded by a constant (independent of the number of iterations).

### General schema
- Starts with an initial state S<sub>0</sub> and transforms the state in steps until reaching a final state S<sub>final</sub>:
    - S<sub>0</sub> -> S<sub>1</sub> -> ... -> S<sub>final</sub>
- General schema:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/general_schema.png"></p>

- Info:
    - Functions *IsDone* and *Transform* are problem dependent.
    - Stack size does not grow when executing *Iterate*.

### Newton's method
- Newton's method for calculating the square root of a positive real number *x* is an iterative computation.
- It starts with a guess *g* and improves that guess iteratively until it is accurate enough.
- The improved guess *g'* is the average of *g* and *x/g*.
    - *g'* = (*g* + *x/g*) / 2
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    Guess = 1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess X}
end

fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
    if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
    else
        {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
    end
end

fun {Improve Guess X}
    (Guess + X/Guess) / 2.0
end

fun {GoodEnough Guess X}
    {Abs X-Guess*Guess}/X < 0.00001
end

fun {Abs X} if X<0.0 then ~X else X end end
```

#### Assignment 1
- Define a function *Abs* that calculates the absolute value of a *real* number.
- The following definition does not work:
```
declare
fun {Abs X}
    if X<0 then ~X
    else X
    end
end
```
- Why not? Correct it.

        <summary>Hint</summary>
        The problem is trivial.
    </detalis>

#### Assignment 2
- Define a *Cbrt* function (cube root) that uses the Newton's method to calculate it.
    - The formula for calculating the improved guess: *g'* = (*2g* + *x/g<sup>2</sup>*) / 3

### Using local procedures
- Several helper functions are defined in the Newton's method program above: *SqrtIter*, *Improve*, *GoodEnough*, and *Abs*.
- Where to define helper functions?
    - A function defined only as an aid to define another function should not be visible elsewhere.
- Dependency:
    - *SqrtIter* is needed in *Sqrt*,
    - *Improve* and *GoodEnough* are needed in *SqrtIter*,
    - *Abs* is a utility function that could be used elsewhere.
- There are two basic ways to express this visibility:
    1. All the helper functions are defined in a local statement outside of Sqrt.
    2. Each helper function is defined inside of the function that needs it.

#### Way 1
- All the helper functions are defined in a local statement outside of Sqrt.
```
local
    fun {Improve Guess X} ... end
    fun {GoodEnough Guess X} ... end
    fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
        if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
        else
           {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
        end
    end
end
in
    fun {Sqrt X}
        Guess=1.0
    in
        {SqrtIter Guess X}
    end
end
```

#### Way 2
- Each helper function is defined inside of the function that needs it.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
        fun {Improve Guess X} ... end
        fun {GoodEnough Guess X} ... end
    in
        if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess X}
end
```

#### Way 2, simplified
- Each helper function sees the arguments of its enclosing function as external references.
    - This means we can remove these arguments from the helper functions.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {SqrtIter Guess}
        fun {Improve} ... end
        fun {GoodEnough} ... end
    in
        if {GoodEnough} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve}}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess}
end
```

#### Final definition
- There is a trade-off between putting the helper definitions outside the function that needs them or putting them inside:
    - Putting them **inside** lets them see the arguments of the main function (therefore they need fewer arguments). But each time the main function is called, new helper functions are created.
    - Putting them **outside** means that the functions are created once, for all calls to the main function. But then the helper functions need more arguments.
- The final definition (below) balances that trade-off (between efficiency and visibility).
    - *SqrtIter* is local to *Sqrt*.
    - *Improve* and *GoodEnough* are outside *SqrtIter*.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {Improve Guess} ... end
    fun {GoodEnough Guess} ... end
    fun {SqrtIter Guess}
        if {GoodEnough Guess} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve Guess}}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess}
end
```

### Control abstraction
- Here is once again the schema for the *iteration* control flow:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/general_schema.png"></p>

- We will now turn that schema into a program component, making the schema a *control abstraction*.
    - The schema has to be parameterized by extracting the parts that vary from one use to another.
        - *IsDone* and *Transform* are such parts.
```
fun {Iterate S IsDone Transform}
    if {IsDone S} then S
    else S1 in
        S1 = {Transform S}
        {Iterate S1 IsDone Transform}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - Arguments *IsDone* and *Transform* accept one-argument functions.
- We can make *Iterate* behave like *SqrtIter* by passing it the functions *GoodEnough* and *Improve*:
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    { Iterate
        1.0
        fun {$ G} {Abs X-G*G}/X < 0.00001 end
        fun {$ G} (G+X/G)/2.0 end }
end
```
- This is a powerful way to structure a program because it separates the general control flow from this particular use.

#### Assignment 3
- The half-interval method is a technique for finding roots of a function *f* (the x values such that the function *f(x) = 0*), where *f* is a continuous real function.
- If we are given points *a* and *b* such that *f(a) < 0 < f(b)*, then *f* must have at least one root between *a* and *b*.
- Steps to calculate a root:
    - Let `x = (a+b)/2` and compute *f(x)*.
    - If *f(x) > 0* then *f* must have a root between *a* and *x*, otherwise the root is between *x* and *b*.
    - Repeat until the calculated *x* is accurate enough.
- Write a declarative program to solve this problem using the techniques of iterative computation.
    - {HalfInterRoot F A B}
        - Pass a continuous real function to the argument F.
        - Pass values *a* and *b* to arguments A and B.
        - Return a value that approximates a root of the function.

## 2. Recursive computation
- Iterative computation is a special case of *recursive computation*.
    - While iterative computation calls itself once (and has a constant stack size), recursive computation can call itself more than once.
- Recursion occurs in two major ways: in functions and in data types.
    - A function is recursive if its definition has at least one call to itself.
    - A data type is recursive if it is defined in terms of itself (e.g., list).

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/escher_gallery.jpg"><br>Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)</p>

- Iterative computation has a constant stack size, which is not always the case with recursive computation.
    - It is important to avoid growing stack size whenever possible.
- The factorial implementation below is an example of a recursive computation that is not iterative (its stack size is growing).
- Factorial mathematical definition:
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large 0! = 1">
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large n! = n*(n-1)! \quad if \quad n>0">
    - $\large n! = n*(n-1)! \quad if \quad n>0$
- Implementation:
```
fun {Fact N}
    if N==0 then 1
    elseif N>0 then N*{Fact N-1}
    else raise domainError end
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - This defines the factorial of a big number in terms of the factorial of a smaller number.
    - Since all numbers are nonnegative, they will bottom out at zero.

#### Growing stack size
- In the factorial implementation above, multiplication comes *after* the recursive call (tail recursion).
    - During the recursive call the stack has to keep information about the multiplication for when the recursive call returns.

#### Converting a recursive to an iterative computation
- Previous implementation for factorial calculation:
    - `3! = (3*(2*(1*1)))`
- We can rearrange the numbers like this:
    - `3! = (((1*3)*2)*1)`
- The second calculation can be done incrementally.
- The iterative definition that calculates factorial in this way is:
```
fun {Fact N}
    fun {FactIter N A}
        if N==0 then A
        elseif N>0 then {FactIter N-1 A*N}
        else raise domainError end
        end
    end
in
    {FactIter N 1}
end
```
- Info:
    - The function that does the iteration, *FactIter*, has a second argument *A* without which iterative factorial would not be possible. It effectively serves as memory for the intermediate results of multiplication.

## 3. Programming with recursion
- This section shows basic techniques for programming with lists, queues, and trees.

### Programming with lists
- The basic techniques of programming with lists are:
    - Thinking recursively (solve a problem in terms of smaller versions of the problem).
    - Converting recursive to iterative computations (naive list programs are often wasteful).
    - Constructing programs by following the type (recursive structure of a program often closely mirrors the definition of a type with which it calculates).

#### Thinking recursively
- A list is a *recursive* data structure: it is defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.
- The function that calculates on lists consists of two parts:
    - *A base case*: For small lists, the function computes the answer directly.
    - *A recursive case*: For bigger lists, the function computes the result in terms of the results of one or more smaller lists.
- Example of a recursive function that calculates the length of a list:
```
fun {Length Ls}
    case Ls
    of nil then 0
    [] _|Lr then 1+{Length Lr}
    end
end
{Browse {Length [a b c]}}
```
- Info:
    - The base case is the empty list *nil*, for which the function returns 0.
    - The recursive case is any other list.
    - If the list has length *n*, then its tail has length *n-1*. As the tail is smaller than the original list, the program will terminate.
- Example of a function that appends two lists *Ls* and *Ms* together to make a third list:
```
fun {Append Ls Ms}
    case Ls
    of nil then Ms
    [] X|Lr then X|{Append Lr Ms}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - The function follows two properties of append:
        - append(nil, m) = m
        - append(x|t, m) = x | append(t, m)
    - The recursive case always calls *Append* with a smaller first argument, so the program terminates.

#### Exercise 1
- Define the function *Nth* to get the nth element of a list.
    - {Nth Xs N}, where Xs is a list and N an integer.
    <details>
        <summary>Help</summary>
        Base case: if N is 1, return the head of the list.<br>
        Recursive case: if N>1, calculate *Nth* on the tail.
    </detalis>

#### Exercise 2
- Define the function *SumList* that sums all the elements of a list of integers.
    - {SumList Xs}, where Xs is a list.
    <details>
        <summary>Help</summary>
        Base case: in case Xs is nil, return 0.<br>
        Recursive case: otherwise, when Xs is of shape "X|Xr", then sum the head with the result of *SumList* on the tail.
    </detalis>

#### Naive recursive definition
- Let us define a function to reverse the elements of a list.
- Recursive definition of list reversal:
    - reverse(nil) = nil.
    - reverse(X|Xs) = append( reverse(Xs), [X] ).
- Implementation:
```
fun {Reverse Xs}
    case Xs
    of nil then nil
    [] X|Xr then
        {Append {Reverse Xr} [X]}
    end
end
```
- *Reverse* execution time:
    - N recursive calls (which contain calls to Append).
    - Each Append call will process a list of length n/2 on average.
    - The total execution time is therefore proportional to n\*n/2, namely n<sup>2</sup>.
    - We would expect that reversing a list would take time proportional to the input length and not to its square.
- *Reverse* stack size:
    - The stack size grows with the input list length (recursive computation that is not iterative).
- Naively following the *reverse* recursive definition has given us an inefficient result.

#### Converting recursive to iterative computations
- Here we will see how to convert recursive computations into iterative ones.
- Instead of using *Reverse*, we first use a simpler function that calculates the length of a list.
- Naive implementation:
```
fun {Length Xs}
    case Xs of
    nil then 0
    [] _|Xr then
        1+{Length Xr}
    end
end
```
- This function is linear in time, but the stack size is proportional to the recursive depth.
    - This occurs because the addition 1+{Length Xr} happens *after* the recursive call.
- Iterative implementation:
```
local
    fun {IterLength I Ys}
        case Ys
        of nil then I
        [] _|Yr then
            {IterLength I+1 Yr}
        end
    end
in
    fun {Length Xs}
        {IterLength 0 Xs}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - It uses an accumulator that effectively serves as a memory for length (the first argument in IterLength function).
- We can use the same technique on *Reverse*.
    - Use the accumulator as memory for "*the reverse of the part of the list already seen*" instead of its length.
```
local
    fun {IterReverse Rs Ys}
        case Ys
        of nil then Rs
        [] Y|Yr then
            {IterReverse Y|Rs Yr}
        end
    end
in
    fun {Reverse Xs}
        {IterReverse nil Xs}
    end
end
```
- Now, the *Reverse* implementation should be both linear-time and iterative computation.

#### Assignment 4
- Rewrite the function *SumList* (from Exercise 2) to be iterative using the techniques developed for *Length*.

#### Assignment 5
- The *Append* implementation from a previous section is iterative (the stack size is constant):
```
fun {Append Ls Ms}
    case Ls
    of nil then Ms
    [] X|Lr then X|{Append Lr Ms}
    end
end
```
- It is iterative in the declarative paradigm (which has dataflow variables, allowing the unfinished list to have unbound variables).
- In the functional paradigm (which is a subset of the declarative paradigm), where variables must be immediately bound, the implementation above is not iterative.
    - In the functional paradigm the stack size would be proportional to the recursive depth because the list appending operation ("|") would execute after the recursion.
- Write an iterative append that would be iterative even in the functional paradigm (restrict the declarative paradigm to calculate with values only - no unbound variables).
    - You will need the *Reverse* function and a new iterative function that appends the reverse of a list to another list (which is not reversed).
    <details>
        <summary>Hint</summary>
        [1 2] + [3 4] -> append( reverse([1 2]), [3 4] )<br>

        [1], [2 3 4] -> 1 | [2 3 4]<br>
        [], [1 2 3 4]
    </detalis>

#### Sorting with mergesort
- Let's define a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list sorted in ascending order.
- We use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRPoEKHXTJg">mergesort</a> algorithm which is based on a simple divide-and-conquer strategy:
    - Split the list into two smaller lists (of approximately equal length).
    - Use mergesort recursively to sort two smaller lists.
    - Merge the two sorted lists together.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/mergesort.png"></p>

```
proc {Split Xs ?Ys ?Zs}
    case Xs
    of nil then Ys=nil Zs=nil
    [] [X] then Ys=[X] Zs=nil
    [] X1|X2|Xr then Yr Zr in
        Ys=X1|Yr
        Zs=X2|Zr
        {Split Xr Yr Zr}
    end
end

fun {Merge Xs Ys}
    case Xs # Ys
    of nil # Ys then Ys
    [] Xs # nil then Xs
    [] (X|Xr) # (Y|Yr) then
        if X<Y then X|{Merge Xr Ys}
        else Y|{Merge Xs Yr}
        end
    end
end

fun {MergeSort Xs}
    case Xs
    of nil then nil
    [] [X] then [X]
    else Ys Zs in
        {Split Xs Ys Zs}
        {Merge {MergeSort Ys} {MergeSort Zs}}
    end
end
```

### Accumulators
- Accumulator programming is a technique for writing iterative computations (used in *IterLength* and *IterReverse* functions we saw before).
- The main idea is to carry state forward at all times and never do a return calculation.

#### Mergesort with an accumulator
- The previous definition of mergesort first calls the function *Split* to divide the input list into two halves.
- The simpler way to do mergesort is by using an accumulator.
    - The parameter represents "*the part of the list still to be sorted*."
- The specification of *MergeSortAcc*:
    - S#L2 = {MergeSortAcc L1 N} takes an input list L1 and an integer N. It returns two results: S, the sorted list of the first N elements of L1, and L2, the remaining elements of L1. The two results are paired together with the # tupling constructor.
- Implementation:
```
fun {MergeSort Xs}
    fun {MergeSortAcc L1 N}
        if N==0 then
            nil # L1
        elseif N==1 then
            [L1.1] # L1.2
        elseif N>1 then
            NL = N div 2
            NR = N-NL
            Ys # L2 = {MergeSortAcc L1 NL}
            Zs # L3 = {MergeSortAcc L2 NR}
        in
            {Merge Ys Zs} # L3
        end
    end
in
    {MergeSortAcc Xs {Length Xs}}.1
end
```
- This version has the same time complexity as the previous version, but it uses less memory because it does not create the two split lists.

### Queues
- A queue is a sequence of elements with an *insert* and a *delete* operation.
    - The insert operation adds an element to one end of the queue and the delete operation removes an element from the other end.
    - Queues have FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.

#### A naive queue
- If a list L represents the queue content, then inserting X gives the new queue X|L and deleting X is done by calling {ButLast L X L1} (which binds X to the deleted element and returns the new queue in L1):
```
proc {ButLast L ?X ?L1}
    case L
    of [Y] then X=Y L1=nil
    [] Y|L2 then L3 in
        L1 = Y|L3
        {ButLast L2 X L3}
    end
end
```
- ButLast is slow: it takes time proportional to the number of elements in the queue.

#### Amortized constant-time ephemeral queue
- Amortized constant-time: a sequence of n function/procedure calls takes a total time that is proportional to some constant times n.
- Ephemeral queue: there can be only one version of the queue in use at any time.
- Definition of an ephemeral queue that has amortized constant-time:
```
fun {NewQueue} q(nil nil) end

fun {Check Q}
    case Q of q(nil R) then q({Reverse R} nil) else Q end
end

fun {Insert Q X}
    case Q of q(F R) then {Check q(F X|R)} end
end

fun {Delete Q X}
    case Q of q(F R) then F1 in F=X|F1 {Check q(F1 R)} end
end

fun {IsEmpty Q}
    case Q of q(F R) then F==nil end
end
```
- Info:
    - This uses the pair q(F R) to represent the queue. F and R are lists.
    - F represents the front of the queue and R represents the back of the queue in reverse.
    - In "Delete" function, "F=X|F1" binds the head of list F to X and the tail to F1.
- Example:
```
Q1 = {NewQueue}         % Q1 = q(nil nil)
Q2 = {Insert Q1 1}      % Q2 = q([1] nil)
Q3 = {Insert Q2 2}      % Q3 = q([1] [2])
Q4 = {Insert Q3 3}      % Q4 = q([1] [3 2])
Q5 = {Insert Q4 4}      % Q5 = q([1] [4 3 2])
Q6 = {Insert Q5 5}      % Q6 = q([1] [5 4 3 2])

Q7 = {Delete Q6 X}      % Q7 = q([2 3 4 5] nil)  X=1
Q8 = {Delete Q7 X}      % Q8 = q([3 4 5] nil)    X=2

Q9  = {Insert Q8 6}     % Q9  = q([3 4 5] [6])
Q10 = {Insert Q9 7}     % Q10 = q([3 4 5] [7 6])

Q11 = {Delete Q10 X}    % Q11 = q([4 5] [7 6])   X=3
```

#### Assignment 6
- Consider the FIFO queue defined above.
    - What happens if you delete an element from an empty queue?
    - Why is it wrong to define IsEmpty as follows?
        - `fun {IsEmpty q(N S E)} S==E end`

### Trees
- Trees are recursive data structures.
- A tree is either a leaf node or a node that contains one or more trees.
- Nodes can carry additional information.
- One possible definition:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/tree_def.png"></p>

- One of many applications for the tree structure: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrrbshL_0-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrrbshL_0-s)

#### Ordered binary tree
- An ordered binary tree (OBTree) is a binary tree in which each node includes a pair of values:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/binary_tree_def.png"></p>

- Non-leaf nodes include the values *OValue* and *Value*.
    - OValue (Ordered Value) is a value by which the nodes in a tree are ordered - **Key**.
    - Value is carried along with no particular condition imposed on it - **Information**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/binary_tree.png"></p>

#### Storing information in trees
- An ordered binary tree can be used as a repository of information.
    - We have to define three operations: looking up, inserting, and deleting entries.
- Looking up information in an ordered binary tree means to search for a given key, and if it is found return the information present at that node.
    - With the orderdness condition, the search algorithm can eliminate half the remaining nodes at each step. The number of operations is proportional to the depth of the tree.
- **Lookup**:
```
fun {Lookup X T}
    case T
    of leaf then notfound
    [] tree(Y V T1 T2) andthen X==Y then found(V)
    [] tree(Y V T1 T2) andthen X<Y  then {Lookup X T1}
    [] tree(Y V T1 T2) andthen X>Y  then {Lookup X T2}
    end
end
```
- To insert or delete information in an ordered binary tree, we construct a new tree that is identical to the original except that it has more or less information.
- **Insert**:
```
fun {Insert X V T}
    case T
    of leaf then tree(X V leaf leaf)
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X==Y then tree(X V T1 T2)
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X<Y  then tree(Y W {Insert X V T1} T2)
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X>Y  then tree(Y W T1 {Insert X V T2})
    end
end
```
- Calling {Insert X V T} returns a new tree that has the pair (X V) inserted in the right place.
    - If T already contains X, then the new tree replaces the old information with V.

#### Deletion and tree reorganizing
- The delete operation is not as simple as Lookup and Insert, here is a first try (which is wrong):
```
fun {Delete X T}
    case T
    of leaf then leaf
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X==Y then leaf
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X<Y  then tree(Y W {Delete X T1} T2)
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X>Y  then tree(Y W T1 {Delete X T2})
    end
end
```
- Calling {Delete X T} should return a new tree that has no node with key X.
    - The error is that when `X==Y`, the whole  subtree is removed instead of just a single node.
- When `X==Y`, we have to reorganize the subtree so that it no longer has the key Y but is still an ordered binary tree.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/tree_node_del_easy.png"><br>Deleting node Y when one subtree is a leaf (easy case)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/tree_node_del_hard.png"><br>Deleting node Y when neither subtree is a leaf (hard case)</p>

- To fix the Delete function, we define a function {RemoveSmallest T2} that returns the smallest key of T2, its associated value, and a new tree that lacks this key:
```
fun {RemoveSmallest T}
    case T
    of leaf then none
    [] tree(Y V T1 T2) then
        case {RemoveSmallest T1}
        of none then Y#V#T2
        [] Yp#Vp#Tp then Yp#Vp#tree(Y V Tp T2)
        end
    end
end
```
- The new Delete function that uses the RemoveSmallest function:
```
fun {Delete X T}
    case T
    of leaf then leaf
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X==Y then
        case {RemoveSmallest T2}
        of none then T1
        [] Yp#Vp#Tp then tree(Yp Vp T1 Tp)
        end
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X<Y then
        tree(Y W {Delete X T1} T2)
    [] tree(Y W T1 T2) andthen X>Y then
        tree(Y W T1 {Delete X T2})
    end
end
```

#### Tree traversal
- Two basic traversals:
    - *depth-first*: for each node, it visits first the left-most subtree, then the node itself, and then the right-most subtree.
    - *breadth-first*: it first traverses all nodes at depth 0, then all nodes at depth 1, etc.
- Depth-first traversal that displays each node's key and information:
```
proc {DFS T}
    case T
    of leaf then skip
    [] tree(Key Val L R) then
        {DFS L}
        {Browse Key#Val}
        {DFS R}
    end
end
```
- Depth-first traversal that calculates a result (a list of all key/value pairs):
```
proc {DFSAcc T S1 ?Sn}
    case T
    of leaf then Sn=S1
    [] tree(Key Val L R) then S2 S3 in
        {DFSAcc L S1 S2}
        S3 = Key#Val|S2
        {DFSAcc R S3 Sn}
    end
end
```
- To implement breadth-first traversal, we need a queue to keep track of all the nodes at a given depth.
    - The next node to visit comes from the head of the queue.
    - The node's two subtrees are added to the tail of the queue.
        - They will be visited when all the other nodes of the queue have been visited (i.e., all the nodes at the current depth).
- Breadth-first traversal implementation with queues from the previous section:
```
proc {BFS T}
    fun {TreeInsert Q T}
        if T\=leaf then {Insert Q T} else Q end
    end
    
    proc {BFSQueue Q1}
        if {IsEmpty Q1} then skip
        else
            X Q2 = {Delete Q1 X}
            tree(Key Val L R) = X
        in
            {Browse Key#Val}
            {BFSQueue {TreeInsert {TreeInsert Q2 L} R}}
        end
    end
in
    {BFSQueue {TreeInsert {NewQueue} T}}
end
```

#### Exercise 3
- Implement breadth-first traversal (BFSAcc) that calculates a list of key/value pairs (with accumulator, similarly as is done with the depth-first algorithm).

#### Assignment 7
- Write a function (ListToTree) that takes an unordered list of key/value pairs and returnes an ordered binary tree.
- Use the function DFSAcc to turn the ordered binary tree into an ordered list.

## 4. Higher-order programming
- Higher-order programming is the collection of programming techniques that become available when using procesure (or function) values in programs.

### Basic operations
- Four basic operations that underlie all the techniques of higher-order programming:
    - **Procedural abstraction**: the ability to convert any statement into a procedure value.
    - **Genericity**: the ability to pass procedure values as arguments to a procedure call.
    - **Instantiation**: the ability to return procedure values as results from a procedure call.
    - **Embedding**: the ability to put procedure values in data structures.

#### Procedural abstraction
- Any statement can be packaged into a procedure, which does not execute the statement, but instead creates a procedure value (a closure).
- Executing the procedure value gives exactly the same result as executing the statement.

#### Genericity
- To make a function generic is to let any specific entity in the function body become an argument of the function.
    - The specific entity is given when the function is called.
- Consider the function *SumList*, which we will make a generic version of:
```
fun {SumList L}
    case L
    of nil then 0
    [] X|L1 then X+{SumList L1}
    end
end
```
- This function has two specific entities: the number **zero** and the operation **plus**. The zero is a neutral element for the plus operation.
    - *Any* neutral element and *any* operation are possible. We give them as parameters, which gives the following generic function:
```
fun {FoldR L F U}
    case L
    of nil then U
    [] X|L1 then {F X {FoldR L1 F U}}
    end
end
```
- SumList definition as a special case of FoldR:
```
fun {SumList L}
    {FoldR L fun {$ X Y} X+Y end 0}
end
```

#### Exercise 4
- Use *FoldR* to define the function "ProductList" that calculates the product of all elements in the list.
- Use *FoldR* to define the function "Some" that returnes *true* if there is at least one *true* in the list.

#### Instantiation
- An example of instantiation is a function *MakeSort* that returnes a sorting function:
```
fun {MakeSort F}
    fun {$ L}
        {Sort L F}
    end
end
```

#### Embedding
- Procedure values can be put in data structures. This has many uses:
    - **Explicit lazy evaluation** (delayed evaluation): building a data structure on demand.
    - **Modules**: records that group together a set of related operations.
    - **Software component**: a generic procedure that takes a set of modules as input arguments and returnes a new module.

## 5. Abstract data types
- A *data type* (or simply *type*) is a set of values together with a set of operations on these values.
- The declarative model comes with a predefined set of types.
    - In Addition to these, the user is free to define new types.
- A type is *abstract* if it is completely defined by its set of operations, regardless of the implementation.
    - It is possible to change the implementation of the type without changing its use.

### A declarative stack
- A stack is a simple example of an abstract data type.
    - \<Stack T\> contains elements of type T (T being of any type).
