# 2. Declarative Programming Techniques

>"The nice thing about declarative programming is that you can write a specification and run it as a program. The nasty thing about declarative programming is that some clear specifications make incredibly bad programs. The hope of declarative programming is that you can move from a specification to a reasonable program without leaving the language."   
>\- The Craft of Prolog, Richard O’Keefe

- An operation is declarative if it always returns the same results (when called with the same arguments) independent of any other computation state.
- A declarative operation is:
    - independent,
    - stateless,
    - deterministic.
- Declarative programming is important because of two properties:
    - Declarative programs are compositional.
        - They consist of components that can each be written, tested, and proved correct *independently* of other components and of their own past history (previous calls).
    - Reasoning about declarative programs is simple.
        - Simple algebraic and logical reasoning can be used.
- Not all programs can be easily written in the declarative model.
    - As many components (in a program) as possible should be declarative.
- This chapter explains how to write practical declarative programs.
- The basic technique for writing declarative programs:
    - Consider the program as a set of recursive function definitions.
    - Use high-orderness to simplify the program structure.

## 1. Iterative computation
- An iterative computation is a loop whose stack size is bounded by a constant (independent of the number of iterations).

### General schema
- Starts with an initial state S<sub>0</sub> and transforms the state in steps until reaching a final state S<sub>final</sub>:
    - S<sub>0</sub> -> S<sub>1</sub> -> ... -> S<sub>final</sub>
- General schema:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/general_schema.png"></p>

- Info:
    - Functions *IsDone* and *Transform* are problem dependent.
    - Stack size does not grow when executing *Iterate*.

### Newton's method
- Newton's method for calculating the square root of a positive real number *x* is an iterative computation.
- It starts with a guess *g* and improves that guess iteratively until it is accurate enough.
- The improved guess *g'* is the average of *g* and *x/g*.
    - *g'* = (*g* + *x/g*) / 2
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    Guess = 1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess X}
end

fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
    if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
    else
        {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
    end
end

fun {Improve Guess X}
    (Guess + X/Guess) / 2.0
end

fun {GoodEnough Guess X}
    {Abs X-Guess*Guess}/X < 0.00001
end

fun {Abs X} if X<0.0 then ~X else X end end
```

#### Assignment 1
- Define a function *Abs* that calculates the absolute value of a *real* number.
- The following definition does not work:
```
declare
fun {Abs X}
    if X<0 then ~X
    else X
    end
end
```
- Why not? Correct it.

        <summary>Hint</summary>
        The problem is trivial.
    </detalis>

#### Assignment 2
- Define a *Cbrt* function (cube root) that uses the Newton's method to calculate it.
    - The formula for calculating the improved guess: *g'* = (*2g* + *x/g<sup>2</sup>*) / 3

### Using local procedures
- Several helper functions are defined in the Newton's method program above: *SqrtIter*, *Improve*, *GoodEnough*, and *Abs*.
- Where to define helper functions?
    - A function defined only as an aid to define another function should not be visible elsewhere.
- Dependency:
    - *SqrtIter* is needed in *Sqrt*,
    - *Improve* and *GoodEnough* are needed in *SqrtIter*,
    - *Abs* is a utility function that could be used elsewhere.
- There are two basic ways to express this visibility:
    1. All the helper functions are defined in a local statement outside of Sqrt.
    2. Each helper function is defined inside of the function that needs it.

#### Way 1
- All the helper functions are defined in a local statement outside of Sqrt.
```
local
    fun {Improve Guess X} ... end
    fun {GoodEnough Guess X} ... end
    fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
        if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
        else
           {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
        end
    end
end
in
    fun {Sqrt X}
        Guess=1.0
    in
        {SqrtIter Guess X}
    end
end
```

#### Way 2
- Each helper function is defined inside of the function that needs it.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {SqrtIter Guess X}
        fun {Improve Guess X} ... end
        fun {GoodEnough Guess X} ... end
    in
        if {GoodEnough Guess X} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve Guess X} X}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess X}
end
```

#### Way 2, simplified
- Each helper function sees the arguments of its enclosing function as external references.
    - This means we can remove these arguments from the helper functions.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {SqrtIter Guess}
        fun {Improve} ... end
        fun {GoodEnough} ... end
    in
        if {GoodEnough} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve}}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess}
end
```

#### Final definition
- There is a trade-off between putting the helper definitions outside the function that needs them or putting them inside:
    - Putting them **inside** lets them see the arguments of the main function (therefore they need fewer arguments). But each time the main function is called, new helper functions are created.
    - Putting them **outside** means that the functions are created once, for all calls to the main function. But then the helper functions need more arguments.
- The final definition (below) balances that trade-off (between efficiency and visibility).
    - *SqrtIter* is local to *Sqrt*.
    - *Improve* and *GoodEnough* are outside *SqrtIter*.
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    fun {Improve Guess} ... end
    fun {GoodEnough Guess} ... end
    fun {SqrtIter Guess}
        if {GoodEnough Guess} then Guess
        else
            {SqrtIter {Improve Guess}}
        end
    end
    Guess=1.0
in
    {SqrtIter Guess}
end
```

### Control abstraction
- Here is once again the schema for the *iteration* control flow:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/general_schema.png"></p>

- We will now turn that schema into a program component, making the schema a *control abstraction*.
    - The schema has to be parameterized by extracting the parts that vary from one use to another.
        - *IsDone* and *Transform* are such parts.
```
fun {Iterate S IsDone Transform}
    if {IsDone S} then S
    else S1 in
        S1 = {Transform S}
        {Iterate S1 IsDone Transform}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - Arguments *IsDone* and *Transform* accept one-argument functions.
- We can make *Iterate* behave like *SqrtIter* by passing it the functions *GoodEnough* and *Improve*:
```
fun {Sqrt X}
    { Iterate
        1.0
        fun {$ G} {Abs X-G*G}/X < 0.00001 end
        fun {$ G} (G+X/G)/2.0 end }
end
```
- This is a powerful way to structure a program because it separates the general control flow from this particular use.

#### Assignment 3
- The half-interval method is a technique for finding roots of a function *f* (the x values such that the function *f(x) = 0*), where *f* is a continuous real function.
- If we are given points *a* and *b* such that *f(a) < 0 < f(b)*, then *f* must have at least one root between *a* and *b*.
- Steps to calculate a root:
    - Let `x = (a+b)/2` and compute *f(x)*.
    - If *f(x) > 0* then *f* must have a root between *a* and *x*, otherwise the root is between *x* and *b*.
    - Repeat until the calculated *x* is accurate enough.
- Write a declarative program to solve this problem using the techniques of iterative computation.
    - {HalfInterRoot F A B}
        - Pass a continuous real function to the argument F.
        - Pass values *a* and *b* to arguments A and B.
        - Return a value that approximates a root of the function.

## 2. Recursive computation
- Iterative computation is a special case of *recursive computation*.
    - While iterative computation calls itself once (and has a constant stack size), recursive computation can call itself more than once.
- Recursion occurs in two major ways: in functions and in data types.
    - A function is recursive if its definition has at least one call to itself.
    - A data type is recursive if it is defined in terms of itself (e.g., list).

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlo-babic/paradigms/main/img/escher_gallery.jpg"><br>Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)</p>

- Iterative computation has a constant stack size, which is not always the case with recursive computation.
    - It is important to avoid growing stack size whenever possible.
- The factorial implementation below is an example of a recursive computation that is not iterative (its stack size is growing).
- Factorial mathematical definition:
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large 0! = 1">
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large n! = n*(n-1)! \quad if \quad n>0">
- Implementation:
```
fun {Fact N}
    if N==0 then 1
    elseif N>0 then N*{Fact N-1}
    else raise domainError end
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - This defines the factorial of a big number in terms of the factorial of a smaller number.
    - Since all numbers are nonnegative, they will bottom out at zero.

#### Growing stack size
- In the factorial implementation above, multiplication comes *after* the recursive call (tail recursion).
    - During the recursive call the stack has to keep information about the multiplication for when the recursive call returns.

#### Converting a recursive to an iterative computation
- Previous implementation for factorial calculation:
    - `3! = (3*(2*(1*1)))`
- We can rearrange the numbers like this:
    - `3! = (((1*3)*2)*1)`
- The second calculation can be done incrementally.
- The iterative definition that calculates factorial in this way is:
```
fun {Fact N}
    fun {FactIter N A}
        if N==0 then A
        elseif N>0 then {FactIter N-1 A*N}
        else raise domainError end
        end
    end
in
    {FactIter N 1}
end
```
- Info:
    - The function that does the iteration, *FactIter*, has a second argument *A* without which iterative factorial would not be possible. It effectively serves as memory for the intermediate results of multiplication.

## 3. Programming with recursion
- This section shows basic techniques for programming with lists, queues, and trees.

### Programming with lists
- The basic techniques of programming with lists are:
    - Thinking recursively (solve a problem in terms of smaller versions of the problem).
    - Converting recursive to iterative computations (naive list programs are often wasteful).
    - Constructing programs by following the type (recursive structure of a program often closely mirrors the definition of a type with which it calculates).

#### Thinking recursively
- A list is a *recursive* data structure: it is defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.
- The function that calculates on lists consists of two parts:
    - *A base case*: For small lists, the function computes the answer directly.
    - *A recursive case*: For bigger lists, the function computes the result in terms of the results of one or more smaller lists.
- Example of a recursive function that calculates the length of a list:
```
fun {Length Ls}
    case Ls
    of nil then 0
    [] _|Lr then 1+{Length Lr}
    end
end
{Browse {Length [a b c]}}
```
- Info:
    - The base case is the empty list *nil*, for which the function returnes 0.
    - The recursive case is any other list.
    - If the list has length *n*, then its tail has length *n-1*. As the tail is smaller than the original list, the program will terminate.
- Example of a function that appends two lists *Ls* and *Ms* together to make a third list:
```
fun {Append Ls Ms}
    case Ls
    of nil then Ms
    [] X|Lr then X|{Append Lr Ms}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - The function follows two properties of append:
        - append(nil, m) = m
        - append(x|t, m) = x | append(t, m)
    - The recursive case always calls *Append* with a smaller first argument, so the program terminates.

#### Exercise 1
- Define the function *Nth* to get the nth element of a list.
    - {Nth Xs N}, where Xs is a list and N an integer.
    <details>
        <summary>Help</summary>
        Base case: if N is 1, return the head of the list.<br>
        Recursive case: if N>1, calculate *Nth* on the tail.
    </detalis>

#### Exercise 2
- Define the function *SumList* that sums all the elements of a list of integers.
    - {SumList Xs}, where Xs is a list.
    <details>
        <summary>Help</summary>
        Base case: in case Xs is nil, return 0.<br>
        Recursive case: otherwise, when Xs is of shape "X|Xr", then sum the head with the result of *SumList* on the tail.
    </detalis>

#### Naive recursive definition
- Let us define a function to reverse the elements of a list.
- Recursive definition of list reversal:
    - reverse(nil) = nil.
    - reverse(X|Xs) = append( reverse(Xs), [X] ).
- Implementation:
```
fun {Reverse Xs}
    case Xs
    of nil then nil
    [] X|Xr then
        {Append {Reverse Xr} [X]}
    end
end
```
- *Reverse* execution time:
    - N recursive calls (which contain calls to Append).
    - Each Append call will process a list of length n/2 on average.
    - The total execution time is therefore proportional to n\*n/2, namely n<sup>2</sup>.
    - We would expect that reversing a list would take time proportional to the input length and not to its square.
- *Reverse* stack size:
    - The stack size grows with the input list length (recursive computation that is not iterative).
- Naively following the *reverse* recursive definition has given us an inefficient result.

#### Converting recursive to iterative computations
- Here we will see how to convert recursive computations into iterative ones.
- Instead of using *Reverse*, we first use a simpler function that calculates the length of a list.
- Naive implementation:
```
fun {Length Xs}
    case Xs of
    nil then 0
    [] _|Xr then
        1+{Length Xr}
    end
end
```
- This function is linear in time, but the stack size is proportional to the recursive depth.
    - This occurs because the addition 1+{Length Xr} happens *after* the recursive call.
- Iterative implementation:
```
local
    fun {IterLength I Ys}
        case Ys
        of nil then I
        [] _|Yr then
            {IterLength I+1 Yr}
        end
    end
in
    fun {Length Xs}
        {IterLength 0 Xs}
    end
end
```
- Info:
    - It uses an accumulator that effectively serves as a memory for length (the first argument in IterLength function).
- We can use the same technique on *Reverse*.
    - Use the accumulator as memory for "*the reverse of the part of the list already seen*" instead of its length.
```
local
    fun {IterReverse Rs Ys}
        case Ys
        of nil then Rs
        [] Y|Yr then
            {IterReverse Y|Rs Yr}
        end
    end
in
    fun {Reverse Xs}
        {IterReverse nil Xs}
    end
end
```
- Now, the *Reverse* implementation should be both linear-time and iterative computation.

#### Assignment 4
- Rewrite the function *SumList* (from Exercise 2) to be iterative using the techniques developed for *Length*.

#### Assignment 5
- The *Append* implementation from a previous section is iterative (the stack size is constant):
```
fun {Append Ls Ms}
    case Ls
    of nil then Ms
    [] X|Lr then X|{Append Lr Ms}
    end
end
```
- It is iterative in the declarative paradigm (which has dataflow variables, allowing the unfinished list to have unbound variables).
- In the functional paradigm (which is a subset of the declarative paradigm), where variables must be immediately bound, the implementation above is not iterative.
    - In the functional paradigm the stack size would be proportional to the recursive depth because the list appending operation ("|") would execute after the recursion.
- Write an iterative append that would be iterative even in the functional paradigm (restrict the declarative paradigm to calculate with values only - no unbound variables).
    - You will need the *Reverse* function and a new iterative function that appends the reverse of a list to another list (which is not reversed).
    <details>
        <summary>Hint</summary>
        [1 2] + [3 4] -> append( reverse([1 2]), [3 4] )<br>
        [2 1], [3 4] -> 2 | [3 4]<br>
        [1], [2 3 4] -> 1 | [2 3 4]<br>
        [], [1 2 3 4]
    </detalis>

#### Sorting with mergesort
- Lets define a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list sorted in ascending order.
- We use the mergesort algorithmm which is based on a simple divide-and-conquer strategy:
    - Split the list into two smaller lists (of approximately equal length).
    - Use mergesort recursively to sort two smaller lists.
    - Merge the two sorted lists together.

```
proc {Split Xs ?Ys ?Zs}
    case Xs
    of nil then Ys=nil Zs=nil
    [] [X] then Ys=[X] Zs=nil
    [] X1|X2|Xr then Yr Zr in
        Ys=X1|Yr
        Zs=X2|Zr
        {Split Xr Yr Zr}
    end
end

fun {Merge Xs Ys}
    case Xs # Ys
    of nil # Ys then Ys
    [] Xs # nil then Xs
    [] (X|Xr) # (Y|Yr) then
        if X<Y then X|{Merge Xr Ys}
        else Y|{Merge Xs Yr}
        end
    end
end

fun {MergeSort Xs}
    case Xs
    of nil then nil
    [] [X] then [X]
    else Ys Zs in
        {Split Xs Ys Zs}
        {Merge {MergeSort Ys} {MergeSort Zs}}
    end
end
```

### Accumulators
- Accumulator programming is a technique for writing iterative computations (used in *IterLength* and *IterReverse* functions we saw before).
- The main idea is to carry state forward at all times and never do a return calculation.

#### Mergesort with an accumulator
- The previous definition of mergesort first calls the function *Split* to divide the input list into two halves.
- The simpler way to do mergesort is by using an accumulator.
    - The parameter represents "*the part of the list still to be sorted*."
- The specification of *MergeSortAcc*:
    - S#L2 = {MergeSortAcc L1 N} takes an input list L1 and an integer N. It returns two results: S, the sorted list of the first N elements of L1, and L2, the remaining elements of L1. The two results are paired together with the # tupling constructor.
- Implementation:
```
fun {MergeSort Xs}
    fun {MergeSortAcc L1 N}
        if N==0 then
            nil # L1
        elseif N==1 then
            [L1.1] # L1.2
        elseif N>1 then
            NL = N div 2
            NR = N-NL
            Ys # L2 = {MergeSortAcc L1 NL}
            Zs # L3 = {MergeSortAcc L2 NR}
        in
            {Merge Ys Zs} # L3
        end
    end
in
    {MergeSortAcc Xs {Length Xs}}.1
end
```
- This version has the same time complexity as the previous version, but it uses less memory because it does not create the two split lists.
